                  <p id="sec-4" class="children-info">The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has more exposure to natural hazards than has been previously recognized. In the last 20 years the UAE has been subject to earthquakes, landslides, floods and tropical storms. This chapter examines the structure and procedures for management of natural disasters in the UAE, in particular issues of governance, accountability and communication within states that are part of a federal system. The study involved interviews with officials at both federal and emirate levels and case studies are presented of the impact of recent natural hazard events. Two emirates were selected for more detailed examination, Fujairah the most hazard prone and a rural emirate and Dubai which is a highly urbanized emirate which has undergone rapid development. There is now increasing awareness of natural hazards in the UAR and progress is being made at regional and federal levels. There needs to be a clear delineation between regional and federal roles and an understanding of the need for effective channels of information to relevant agencies.</p><br>

                  <p id="sec-5" class="children-info">Lightning is usually harmless because most of its charges do not reach the Earth. But in some cases, if it is strong enough, it can uproot a tree, destroy a chimney or even kill a person or an animal. However, it has been shown that most of those who were struck by lightning were usually taking shelter under a tree, and this is the most dangerous thing to do when a thunderstorm breaks out because trees and high-rise buildings actually conduce thunderbolts. Consequently, the roofs of buildings should be equipped with lightning rods; metal chains that absorb electricity and divert their fatal charges to the centre of the Earth. Lightning rods absorb the charges and scatter them peacefully into the ground, away from the building. The massive energy of a thunderbolt is capable of destroying anything that stands in its way</p><br>

Most lightning occurs within the clouds. "Sheet lightning" describes a distant bolt that lights up an entire cloud base. Other visible bolts may appear as bead, ribbon, or rocket lightning.</p><br>

                  <p id="sec-2" class="children-info">An earthquake (also called a quake, tremor, or temblor) is the shaking of the Earth's surface caused by a sudden release of energy in the lithosphere, which results in seismic waves. Earthquakes can range in size from those that are too little to be felt to those that are powerful enough to throw things and people into the air and destroy entire towns. The number, nature, and size of earthquakes experienced in a given area is referred to as seismicity, or seismic activity. Non-earthquake seismic rumbling is also referred to as tremor.</p><br>

                      <p id="sec-2" class="children-info">The earth has four major layers: the inner core, outer core, mantle and crust. The crust and the top of the mantle make up a thin skin on the surface of our planet.</p><br>
                      <h1 id="sec-2" class="titlesss">how do Earthquakes affect business?</h1><br>
                      <p id="sec-2" class="children-info"><br>For starters, earthquakes can activate sprinkler systems and breakwater lines, both of which can cause water to cascade onto important business files.
        
                        Gas lines can also be damaged by earthquakes. Leaking gas can explode into a fire with a single spark, destroying irreplaceable documents and other business assets. Smoke can also harm items that haven't been affected by the flames.
                        
                        Furthermore, seismic activity has the potential to loosen unstable soil, resulting in mudslides and flash floods. Even businesses located far from the epicentre of a quake may be affected.
                        
                        Even if a business is left with mountains of flood-damaged books and documents as a result of an earthquake, document scanning services can repair damaged papers using desiccant air drying and vacuum freeze-drying. Even so, creating a workaround for flood-damaged documents and books before a disaster is less expensive.

                      <p id="sec-2" class="children-info">Earthquakes usually occur on the edges of large sections of the Earth's crust called tectonic plates.
                        Each year, there are an estimated 500,000 earthquakes that can be detected around the world. There are 100,000 of them, and 100 of them inflict damage.
                        Earthquakes usually happen around the west side of the earth in the bottom part of North America and the top part of South America. Earthquakes also commonly occur in Asia around Indonesia, Japan, and Pakistan.</strong></p><br>

                        <p id="sec-1" class="children-info">Floods are the most frequent type of natural disaster and occur when an overflow of water submerges land that is usually dry. Floods are often caused by heavy rainfall, rapid snowmelt or a storm surge from a tropical cyclone or tsunami in coastal areas.

                          Floods can cause widespread devastation, resulting in loss of life and damages to personal property and critical public health infrastructure. Between 1998-2017, floods affected more than 2 billion people worldwide. People who live in floodplains or non-resistant buildings, or lack warning systems and awareness of flooding hazard, are most vulnerable to floods.
                        </p><br>
                        <h1 id="sec-1" class="titlesss">how can a flood affect business?</h1><br>
                        <p id="sec-1" class="children-info">When floods happen, it is not at all uncommon for thousands of residents to be displaced for an extended period. Likewise, many businesses in the path of these storms may be shuttered for days, weeks, or even months. The ripple effects from shutdowns due to floods may be felt for a long time to come and, in some cases, may be impossible to recover from.</p><br>
                        <h1 id="sec-1" class="titlesss">Statistics:</h1><br>
                        <p id="sec-1" class="children-info">An average of 85 people are killed by flooding annually in the United States, according to NOAA (1991-2020). That's more than the average number of deaths per year from tornadoes (69) and hurricanes (46).

                          Only heat claims more lives in an average year than flooding.
                          
                          The deadliest time of year for flooding typically is late spring through the summer when humid air is more abundant. Thunderstorms can drop multi-inch totals quickly, especially when they persist over one area.
                          
                          Tropical depressions, tropical storms and hurricanes also add to flood dangers. This week, Tropical Storm Nicholas will bring the Gulf Coast and parts of the South ample rainfall and potentially life-threatening flooding.</p><br>

                    <p id="sec-4" class="children-info">A tsunami is a sequence of extraordinarily long waves created by a huge and sudden shift in the ocean floor, which is usually caused by an earthquake beneath or near the ocean floor. This force generates waves that travel in all directions away from their source, spanning entire ocean basins in the process. Tsunamis travel through the entire water column, from the ocean floor to the ocean surface, unlike wind-driven waves, which only travel through the highest layer of the.</p><br>

                        <p id="sec-4" class="children-info">A tsunami is a series of long, high sea waves caused by a disturbance in the water. This disturbance can come about in many ways such as an earthquake, landslide, volcanic eruption, or meteorite. The most common causes are volcanic or earthquake activity, and the disturbance itself causes abrupt movement of the water column.Tsunamis are different to the ordinary undersea currents, as these are caused by the gravitational pull of the Moon and Sun, resulting in tides, while some sea waves are caused by the wind. Moreover, tsunamis do not take after normal waves as they have a much longer wavelength (distance between successive peaks).

              <p id="sec-1" class="children-info">A volcano is a crack or opening in the earth's surface through which magma (hot liquid or semi-liquid rock), volcanic ash, and gases can escape. They are most commonly seen where tectonic plates collide or divide, but volcanic hotspots can also cause them to form in the midst of plates. A volcanic eruption occurs when a volcano releases lava and gas, sometimes explosively. A 'glowing avalanche,' which occurs when newly erupted lava slides down the flanks of a volcano, is the most deadly sort of eruption. They have the ability to travel swiftly and reach temperatures of up to 1,200°F. Ash fall and lahars are two other dangers (mud or debris flows). Volcanoes frequently result in human dislocation and food scarcity.</p><br>
              <h1 id="sec-1" class="titlesss">How Volcanoes Erupt?</h1><br>

              <p id="sec-1" class="children-info">All volcanoes share the same basic features. The magma collects in magma chambers that can be 160 kilometers (100 miles) beneath the surface. As the rock heats, it expands, which creates even more pressure. As a result, the magma seeks a way out pushing toward the surface, the magma seeping through cracks in the Earth’s crust called vents. Eventually, the magma reaches the surface; when it comes out, we call it an eruption. The word eruption is used in other contexts, as well. An eruption can be an outburst or explosion, a violent and sudden occurrence, like when a crowd erupts in anger. But an eruption can also be a spreading of something like a rash on your skin, gradual and relatively calm. These two definitions are similar to the two kinds of eruptions that we see in volcanoes.</p><br>
              <h1 id="sec-1" class="titlesss">how can a Volcanic Eruption affect business?</h1><br>
              <p id="sec-1" class="children-info">Volcanic ash falls, like other natural disasters, are unplanned events that can disrupt businesses. Ashfall can cause physical damage to buildings, equipment, computers, machinery, vehicles, inventory, and supplies, and can cause a temporary shutdown of business operations (hours to days or longer). Furthermore, a series of explosive eruptions over a period of weeks to months can result in multiple ashfalls, necessitating costly cleanup operations after each one. One of the most important steps to take to mitigate the potential effects of ash and improve the response and recovery of a business to ashfall is to create a general plan for dealing with emergencies and a specific plan for ashfall. Resources for developing emergency and contingency plans are available elsewhere.

                Businesses and organisations should consider their vulnerability to volcanic ash falls during non-eruptive periods. Mitigation strategies can be developed after the vulnerability has been assessed. (Johnston and Becker, 2001) There are three types of approaches that can be used:
                <br>Policy and management measures that reduce the likelihood of damage or failure of equipment from volcanic ash.
                Engineering design measures that reduce vulnerability to ash.
                Preparedness and response planning to deal with ashfall and cleanup activities.

              <h1 id="sec-1" class="titlesss">Statistics:</h1><br>
              <p id="sec-1" class="children-info">More than 80% of the earth's surface is made up of volcanic rock. Numerous volcanic explosions shaped the sea floor and some mountains. The earth's atmosphere was produced by gaseous eruptions from volcanoes.
                There are over 500 active volcanoes scattered around the world mostly found near the pacific ocean.
                Every year, approximately 50-70 volcanoes erupt on average. Some of them explode more than once, while others only erupt once. The average number of separate eruptions every year is somewhere between 60 and 80.
                A graph that shows how many volcanoes erupt per year from 1790 to 1990. A dramatic increase in the number of eruptions can be seen through the years.</p><br>

              <h1 id="sec-2" class="titlesss">Earthquakes</h1> <br>
              <p id="sec-2" class="children-info">An earthquake (also called a quake, tremor, or temblor) is the shaking of the Earth's surface caused by a sudden release of energy in the lithosphere, which results in seismic waves. Earthquakes can range in size from those that are too little to be felt to those that are powerful enough to throw things and people into the air and destroy entire towns. The number, nature, and size of earthquakes experienced in a given area is referred to as seismicity, or seismic activity. Non-earthquake seismic rumbling is also referred to as tremor.</p><br>
              <h1 id="sec-2" class="children-info">What causes earthquakes and where do they happen?</h1><br>
              <p id="sec-2" class="children-info">The earth has four major layers: the inner core, outer core, mantle and crust. The crust and the top of the mantle make up a thin skin on the surface of our planet.</p><br>
              <h1 id="sec-2" class="children-info">how do Earthquakes affect business?</h1><br>
              <p id="sec-2" class="children-info"><br>For starters, earthquakes can activate sprinkler systems and breakwater lines, both of which can cause water to cascade onto important business files.

                Gas lines can also be damaged by earthquakes. Leaking gas can explode into a fire with a single spark, destroying irreplaceable documents and other business assets. Smoke can also harm items that haven't been affected by the flames.
                
                Furthermore, seismic activity has the potential to loosen unstable soil, resulting in mudslides and flash floods. Even businesses located far from the epicentre of a quake may be affected.
                
                Even if a business is left with mountains of flood-damaged books and documents as a result of an earthquake, document scanning services can repair damaged papers using desiccant air drying and vacuum freeze-drying. Even so, creating a workaround for flood-damaged documents and books before a disaster is less expensive.

              <h1 id="sec-2" class="titlesss">Statistics:</h1><br>
              <p id="sec-2" class="children-info">Earthquakes usually occur on the edges of large sections of the Earth's crust called tectonic plates.
                Each year, there are an estimated 500,000 earthquakes that can be detected around the world. There are 100,000 of them, and 100 of them inflict damage.
                Earthquakes usually happen around the west side of the earth in the bottom part of North America and the top part of South America. Earthquakes also commonly occur in Asia around Indonesia, Japan, and Pakistan.</strong></p><br>

              <p id="sec-3" class="children-info">A tropical cyclone is a low-pressure weather system that rotates around the earth and has structured thunderstorms but no fronts (a boundary separating two air masses of different densities). Tropical depressions are tropical cyclones with maximum sustained surface winds of less than 39 miles per hour (mph). Tropical storms are defined as storms having maximum sustained winds of 39 mph or above.</p><br>

              <p id="sec-3" class="children-info">Tropical cyclones are created from warm, moist air above the ocean waters near the equator. The rising warm air creates an area of lower air pressure and air from surrounding areas with higher air pressure pushes into this lower pressure area.</p><br>
              <h1 id="sec-3" class="children-info">How Some Businesses Lose Out or Fail?</h1><br>
              <p id="sec-3" class="children-info">Hurricanes that cause significant damage may force a business to close for days or even weeks while repairs are made, resulting in a revenue loss that may be difficult to recover from. Few businesses can afford to close their doors for an extended period of time and expect to stay in business.

                How Some Businesses May Benefit
                
                While some businesses, particularly those in the service industry, may benefit from a hurricane, for the most part, these storms only cause business interruptions that can last for months.
                
                In many cases, it is the profit boost that these industries provide that attracts an entrepreneur to a specific location. If you're willing to put up with the inconveniences of hurricanes and tropical storms, such a move could pay off handsomely. Many of these businesses in hurricane-prone areas rely on the five-and-a-half-month hurricane season between June and November to generate the majority of their annual revenue.
              </strong></p><br>
              <h1 id="sec-3" class="titlesss">Statistics:</h1><br>
              <p id="sec-3" class="children-info">Hurricanes are enormous, swirling tropical storms with wind speeds of more than 160 mph and the ability to pour more than 2.4 trillion gallons of rain each day.
                In the Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea, and Gulf of Mexico, an average of ten tropical storms form each year. Many of these are still floating in the ocean. Each year, six of these storms develop into hurricanes.
                Hurricanes happen consistently per year with minor rising and falling in number of occurrences.

              <p id="sec-4" class="children-info">A tsunami is a sequence of extraordinarily long waves created by a huge and sudden shift in the ocean floor, which is usually caused by an earthquake beneath or near the ocean floor. This force generates waves that travel in all directions away from their source, spanning entire ocean basins in the process. Tsunamis travel through the entire water column, from the ocean floor to the ocean surface, unlike wind-driven waves, which only travel through the highest layer of the.</p><br>

              <p id="sec-4" class="children-info">A tsunami is a series of long, high sea waves caused by a disturbance in the water. This disturbance can come about in many ways such as an earthquake, landslide, volcanic eruption, or meteorite. The most common causes are volcanic or earthquake activity, and the disturbance itself causes abrupt movement of the water column.Tsunamis are different to the ordinary undersea currents, as these are caused by the gravitational pull of the Moon and Sun, resulting in tides, while some sea waves are caused by the wind. Moreover, tsunamis do not take after normal waves as they have a much longer wavelength (distance between successive peaks).
